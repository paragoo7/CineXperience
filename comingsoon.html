        <h4>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness </h4>
        <a href="#"><img src="css/images/drstrange.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <p style="color: black;"><strong> Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is an upcoming American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Doctor Strange. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is intended to be the sequel to Doctor Strange (2016) and the 28th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Sam Raimi, written by Michael Waldron, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange, alongside Elizabeth Olsen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Xochitl Gomez, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Rachel McAdams. In the film, Strange and his allies travel into the multiverse to face a mysterious new adversary.

			Doctor Strange director and co-writer Scott Derrickson had plans for a sequel by October 2016. He signed to return as director in December 2018, when Cumberbatch was confirmed to return. The film's title was announced in July 2019 along with Olsen's involvement, while Jade Halley Bartlett was hired to write the film that October. Derrickson stepped down as director in January 2020, citing creative differences, with Waldron and Raimi joining the next month and starting over. Filming began in November 2020 in London but was put on hold in January 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed by March 2021 and concluded in mid-April in Somerset. Shooting also occurred in Surrey and Los Angeles.
			
			Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is scheduled to premiere on May 2, 2022, and will be released in the United States on May 6, as part of Phase Four of the MCU.</strong></p>

        <h4>Thor Love and Thunder</h4>
        <a href="#"><img src="css/images/Thor_Love_and_Thunder_poster.jpeg.webp" alt="" /></a>
        <p style="color: black;"><strong> Love and Thunder is an upcoming American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Thor, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is intended to be the direct sequel to Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and the 29th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Taika Waititi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, and stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor, alongside Tessa Thompson, Natalie Portman, Christian Bale, Chris Pratt, Jaimie Alexander, Pom Klementieff, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Sean Gunn, Jeff Goldblum, Vin Diesel, and Bradley Cooper. In the film, Thor recruits Valkyrie (Thompson), Korg (Waititi), and Jane Foster (Portman)—who is now the Mighty Thor—to stop Gorr the God Butcher (Bale) from eliminating all gods.

			By January 2018, Hemsworth and Waititi had discussed plans for a sequel to Ragnarok. Love and Thunder was officially announced in July 2019, with Hemsworth, Waititi, and Thompson, alongside Portman—who did not appear in Ragnarok—all attached to return to the franchise. Waititi said the film would adapt elements from Jason Aaron's run on the Mighty Thor comic book, which sees Foster take on the mantle and powers of Thor whilst suffering from cancer. Robinson joined the film in February 2020, with Waititi later describing it as a romance film. Filming began in January 2021 in Sydney, Australia, and concluded at the beginning of June.
			
			Thor: Love and Thunder is scheduled to be released in the United States on July 8, 2022, as part of Phase Four of the MCU.</strong></p>
